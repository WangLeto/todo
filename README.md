## About

I make this page for fun.  

To switch css file dynamically, I use a `<base href="/">` tag in the head, which leads to some mess when running the page in local, I suggest add ".." before "/" to solve it.  

Additionally, Microsoft Edge seems not to support a local file page use `localStorage` API, so change to use Chrome or Firefox.
